My capstone project at ITT Technical Institute in Torrance, CA.

## Synopsis

My capstone at ITT Technical Institute in Torrance, CA was to create any program. We decided to keep things sweet and simple, meaning less features, but very stable and solid.  We created a note taking app, using a local SQLite database. The whole program was written in JavaFX. You must run it in Java 8 (Java 7 wonâ€™t work).

The SQLite database is located at ~/.rwbay/note-worthy/SQLite/note-worthy.db

See the project page for more information and links: <a href="http://play.rwbay.com/capstone-itt-technical-institute/">play.rwbay.com/capstone-itt-technical-institute</a>

The project have been compiled and <a href="http://noteworthy.rwbay.com/executable/Noteworthy.jar">packaged as an executable jar here</a>.

## Installation

Add the source files to your project using any IDE. Add the two jar files, jfxrt.jar and sqlite-jdbc-3.8.11.2.jar, in the 'libraries' folder to the projects build path.
